# Busy Bun Buddies

![Busy Bun Buddies cover image](itch_io_cover_image_630x500.png)

The game was originally made for [LOWREZJAM 2023](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2023)
which restricts the resolution to 64x64 pixels and ran for 2 weeks
between 1st and 14th August 2023. The jam had ten optional themes, I
picked a few of them (higlighted in italic in the intro text below)
and tried to include in the game.

## Intro

Busy little buns are doing their jobs to prepare for the winter, it's not
an easy job but they are good at *cooperating*. Sometimes they find
things on the ground, there might be matches *hidden in plain sight* and
Buns are curious creatures, they'll play with it. You have to
*catch 'em all* before they set the forest on fire accidentally and the
*wildfire* spreads to the whole island.
